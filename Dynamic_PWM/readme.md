# Short Description to the Repo
The Repo contains the design and simulation sources to implement an linear fade on the on-board led.
This is been realized by generating a ROM-Memory and an continously updating address generator.
The dutycycle word is outputed to the PWM generator, which controls the led.
A detailed .pdf document,containing in dept detail will be added soon.
