## Project Overview:
The Design realizes an full RGB Fade on the User LED and consists of an 
statemachine controlling three independent pwm units (each containing an pwm signal generator,ROM address generator and ROM array).
Screenshots from the simulation with accordingly changed values can be found under the directory "Simulation".
The following gif shows the functional design, but has been speed up ~10x due to file size limitations:
