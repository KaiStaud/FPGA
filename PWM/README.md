## Introduction
This repo contains the desing sources to implement an PWM-Generator.
The Generator outputs an 10kHz signal with varying dutycyle.

## How to build the project?
Add the provided sources and generate the Bitstream.
Finaly program the FPGA with the Hardware Manager.
( If desired you can create an Hardware Boot Image and burn it to an SD-Card,
this way the FPGA programs itself at booting.)
